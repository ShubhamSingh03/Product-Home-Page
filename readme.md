## Description

This project [Product Home Page](https://earphone-page.netlify.app/) was built using Semantic HTML and CSS. The main goal for building this webpage was to apply the concepts which I have learned in the bootcamp[FS Js Bootcamp, Ineuron] and make the webpage responsive for all major devices.The difficulty was faced while making webpage responsive with **@media queries**. Making the webpage responsive was way time-consuming but I learnt alot. The Project was completed under guidance of [Hitesh Choudhary](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary), CTO Ineuron
